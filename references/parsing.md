# Parsing

grug love make programming language at drop of hat and say recursive descent most fun and beautiful
way create parser

unfortunately many big brain school teach only parser generator tool. here grug usual love of tool
is not: parser generator tool generate code of awful snakes nest: impossible understand, bottom up,
what? hide recursive nature of grammar from grug and debug impossible, very bad according grug!

grug think this because while complexity demon bad for code base and understand, complexity demon
very good for generation of much academic papers, sad but true

production parser almost always recursive descent, despite ignore by schools! grug furious when
learn how simple parse is! parsing not big brain only magic: so can you!

grug very elated find big brain developer Bob Nystrom redeem the big brain tribe and write excellent
book on recursive descent: Crafting Interpreters

book available online free, but grug highly recommend all interested grugs purchase book on general
principle, provide much big brain advice and grug love book very much except visitor pattern (trap!)
