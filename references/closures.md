# Closures

grug like closures for right job and that job usually abstracting operation over collection of
objects

grug warn closures like salt, type systems and generics: small amount go long way, but easy spoil
things too much use give heart attack

javascript developers call very special complexity demon spirit in javascript "callback hell"
because too much closure used by javascript libraries very sad but also javascript developer get
what deserved let grug be frank
