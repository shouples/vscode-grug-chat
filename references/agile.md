# Agile

grug think agile not terrible, not good

end of day, not worst way to organize development, maybe better than others grug supposes is fine

danger, however, is agile shaman! many, many shiney rock lost to agile shaman!

whenever agile project fail, agile shaman say "you didn't do agile right!" grug note this awfully
convenient for agile shaman, ask more shiney rock better agile train young grugs on agile, danger!

grug tempted reach for club when too much agile talk happen but always stay calm

prototyping, tools and hiring good grugs better key to success software: agile process ok and help
some but sometimes hurt taken too seriously

grug say no silver club fix all software problems no matter what agile shaman say (danger!)
