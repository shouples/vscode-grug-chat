## Saying ok

sometimes compromise necessary or no shiney rock, mean no dinosaur meat, not good, wife firmly
remind grug about young grugs at home need roof, food, and so forth, no interest in complexity demon
spirit rant by grug for fiftieth time

in this situation, grug recommend "ok"

"ok, grug build that feature"

then grug spend time think of 80/20 solution to problem and build that instead. 80/20 solution say
"80 want with 20 code" solution maybe not have all bell-whistle that project manager want, maybe a
little ugly, but work and deliver most value, and keep demon complexity spirit at bay for most part
to extent

sometimes probably best just not tell project manager and do it 80/20 way. easier forgive than
permission, project managers mind like butterfly at times overworked and dealing with many grugs.
often forget what even feature supposed to do or move on or quit or get fired grug see many such
cases

anyway is in project managers best interest anyway so grug not to feel too bad for this approach
usually
