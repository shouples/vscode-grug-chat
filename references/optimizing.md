# Optimizing

ultra biggest of brain developer once say:

premature optimization is the root of all evil

this everyone mostly know and grug in humble violent agreement with ultra biggest of big brain

grug recommend always to have concrete, real world perf profile showing specific perf issue before
begin optimizing.

never know what actual issue might be, grug often surprise! very often!

beware only cpu focus: easy to see cpu and much big o notation thinking having been done in school,
but often not root of all slowness, surprise to many including grug

hitting network equivalent of many, many millions cpu cycle and always to be minimized if possible,
note well big brain microservice developer!

inexperienced big brain developer see nested loop and often say "O(n^2)? Not on my watch!"

complexity demon spirit smile
