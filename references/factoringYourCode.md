## Factoring Your Code

next strategy very harder: break code base up properly (fancy word: "factor your code properly")
here is hard give general advice because each system so different. however, one thing grug come to
believe: not factor your application too early!

early on in project everything very abstract and like water: very little solid holds for grug's
struggling brain to hang on to. take time to develop "shape" of system and learn what even doing.
grug try not to factor in early part of project and then, at some point, good cut-points emerge from
code base

good cut point has narrow interface with rest of system: small number of functions or abstractions
that hide complexity demon internally, like trapped in crystal

grug quite satisfied when complexity demon trapped properly in crystal, is best feeling to trap
mortal enemy!

grug try watch patiently as cut points emerge from code and slowly refactor, with code base taking
shape over time along with experience. no hard/ fast rule for this: grug know cut point when grug
see cut point, just take time to build skill in seeing, patience

sometimes grug go too early and get abstractions wrong, so grug bias towards waiting

big brain developers often not like this at all and invent many abstractions start of project

grug tempted to reach for club and yell "big brain no maintain code! big brain move on next
architecture committee leave code for grug deal with!"

but grug learn control passions, major difference between grug and animal

instead grug try to limit damage of big brain developer early in project by giving them thing like
UML diagram (not hurt code, probably throw away anyway) or by demanding working demo tomorrow

working demo especially good trick: force big brain make something to actually work to talk about
and code to look at that do thing, will help big brain see reality on ground more quickly

remember! big brain have big brain! need only be harness for good and not in service of spirit
complexity demon on accident, many times seen

(best grug brain able to herd multiple big brain in right direction and produce many complexity
demon trap crystals, large shiney rock pile awaits such grug!)

also sometimes call demo approach "prototype", sound fancier to project manager

grug say prototype early in software making, especially if many big brains
