## Saying No

best weapon against complexity spirit demon is magic word: "no"

"no, grug not build that feature"

"no, grug not build that abstraction"

"no, grug not put water on body every day or drink less black think juice you stop repeat ask now"

note, this good engineering advice but bad career advice: "yes" is magic word for more shiney rock
and put in charge of large tribe of developer

sad but true: learn "yes" then learn blame other grugs when fail, ideal career advice

but grug must to grug be true, and "no" is magic grug word. Hard say at first, especially if you
nice grug and don't like disappoint people (many such grugs!) but easier over time even though
shiney rock pile not as high as might otherwise be

is ok: how many shiney rock grug really need anyway?
