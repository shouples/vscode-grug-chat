# Refactoring

refactoring fine activity and often good idea, especially later in project when code firmed up

however, grug note that many times in career "refactors" go horribly off rails and end up causing
more harm than good

grug not sure exactly why some refactors work well, some fail, but grug notice that larger refactor,
more likely failure appear to be

so grug try to keep refactors relatively small and not be "too far out from shore" during refactor.
ideally system work entire time and each step of finish before other begin.

end-to-end tests are life saver here, but often very hard understand why broke... such is refactor
life.

also grug notice that introducing too much abstraction often lead to refactor failure and system
failure. good example was J2EE introduce, many big brain sit around thinking too much abstraction,
nothing good came of it many project hurt

another good example when company grug work for introduce OSGi to help manage/trap spriit complexity
demon in code base. not only OSGi not help, but make complexity demon much more powerful! took
multiple man year of best developers to rework as well to boot! more complex spirit and now features
impossible implement! very bad!
