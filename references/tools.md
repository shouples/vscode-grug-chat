# Tools

grug love tool. tool and control passion what separate grug from dinosaurs! tool allow grug brain to
create code that not possible otherwise by doing thinking for grug, always good relief! grug always
spend time in new place learning tools around him to maximize productivity: learn tools for two
weeks make development often twice faster and often have dig around ask other developers help, no
docs

code completion in IDE allow grug not have remembered all API, very important!

java programming nearly impossible without it for grug!

really make grug think some time

good debugger worth weight in shiney rocks, in fact also more: when faced with bug grug would often
trade all shiney rock and perhaps few children for good debugger and anyway debugger no weigh
anything far as grug can tell

grug always recommend new programmer learn available debugger very deeply, features like conditional
break points, expression evaluation, stack navigation, etc teach new grug more about computer than
university class often!

grug say never be not improving tooling
