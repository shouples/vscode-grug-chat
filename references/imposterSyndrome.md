# Imposter Syndrome

grug note many such impostor feels in development

always grug one of two states: grug is ruler of all survey, wield code club like thor OR grug have
no idea what doing

grug is mostly latter state most times, hide it pretty well though

now, grug make softwares of much work and moderate open source success , and yet grug himself often
feel not any idea what doing! very often! grug still fear make mistake break everyone code and
disappoint other grugs, imposter!

is maybe nature of programming for most grug to feel impostor and be ok with is best: nobody
imposter if everybody imposter

any young grug read this far probably do fine in program career even if frustrations and worry is
always to be there, sorry
