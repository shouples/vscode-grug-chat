# The Eternal Enemy: Complexity

apex predator of grug is complexity

complexity bad

say again:

complexity very bad

you say now:

complexity very, very bad

given choice between complexity or one on one against t-rex, grug take t-rex: at least grug see
t-rex

complexity is spirit demon that enter codebase through well-meaning but ultimately very clubbable
non grug-brain developers and project managers who not fear complexity spirit demon or even know
about sometime

one day code base understandable and grug can get work done, everything good!

next day impossible: complexity demon spirit has entered code and very dangerous situation!

grug no able see complexity demon, but grug sense presence in code base

demon complexity spirit mocking him make change here break unrelated thing there what!?! mock mock
mock ha ha so funny grug love programming and not becoming shiney rock speculator like grug senior
advise

club not work on demon spirit complexity and bad idea actually hit developer who let spirit in with
club: sometimes grug himself!

sadly, often grug himself

so grug say again and say often: complexity very, very bad
