# Fear Of Looking Dumb

note! very good if senior grug willing to say publicly: "hmmm, this too complex for grug"!

many developers Fear Of Looking Dumb (FOLD), grug also at one time FOLD, but grug learn get over:
very important senior grug say "this too complicated and confuse to me"

this make it ok for junior grugs to admit too complex and not understand as well, often such case!
FOLD major source of complexity demon power over developer, especially young grugs!

take FOLD power away, very good of senior grug!

note: important to make thinking face and look big brained when saying though. be prepare for big
brain or, worse and much more common, thinks is big brain to make snide remark of grug

be strong! no FOLD!

club sometimes useful here, but more often sense of humor and especially last failed project by big
brain very useful, so collect and be calm
