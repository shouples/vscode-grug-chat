# Fads

grug note lots of fads in development, especially front end development today

back end better more boring because all bad ideas have tried at this point maybe (still retry some!)

still trying all bad ideas in front end development so still much change and hard to know

grug recommend taking all revolutionary new approach with grain salt: big brains have working for
long time on computers now, most ideas have tried at least once

grug not saying can't learn new tricks or no good new ideas, but also much of time wasted on
recycled bad ideas, lots of spirit complexity demon power come from putting new idea willy nilly
into code base
