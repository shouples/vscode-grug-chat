# Front End Development

some non-grugs, when faced with web development say:

"I know, I'll split my front end and back end codebase up and use a hot new SPA library talking to a
GraphQL JSON API back end over HTTP (which is funny because I'm not transferring hypertext)"

now you have two complexity demon spirit lairs

and, what is worse, front end complexity demon spirit even more powerful and have deep spiritual
hold on entire front end industry as far as grug can tell

back end developers try keep things simple and can work ok, but front end developers make very
complex very quickly and introduce lots of code, demon complex spirit

even when website just need put form into database or simple brochure site!

everyone do this now!

grug not sure why except maybe facebook and google say so, but that not seem very good reason to
grug

grug not like big complex front end libraries everyone use

grug make htmx and hyperscript to avoid

keep complexity low, simple HTML, avoid lots javascript, the natural ether of spirit complexity
demon

maybe they work for you, but no job post, sorry

react better for job and also some type application, but also you become alcolyte of complexity
demon whether you like or no, sorry such is front end life
