# Chesterton's Fence

wise grug shaman chesterton once say

> here exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a
> fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and
> says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of
> reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear
> it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of
> it, I may allow you to destroy it.”

many older grug learn this lesson well not start tearing code out willy nilly, no matter how ugly
look

grug understand all programmer platonists at some level wish music of spheres perfection in code.
but danger is here, world is ugly and gronky many times and so also must code be

humility not often come big brained or think big brained easily or grug even, but grug often find
"oh, grug no like look of this, grug fix" lead many hours pain grug and no better or system worse
even

grug early on in career often charge into code base waving club wildly and smash up everything,
learn not good

grug not say no improve system ever, quite foolish, but recommend take time understand system first
especially bigger system is and is respect code working today even if not perfect

here tests often good hint for why fence not to be smashed!
