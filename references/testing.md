grug have love/hate relationship with test: test save grug many, many uncountable time and grug love
and respect test

unfortunately also many test shamans exist. some test shaman make test idol, demand things like
"first test" before grug even write code or have any idea what grug doing domain!

how grug test what grug not even understand domain yet!?

"Oh, don't worry: the tests will show you what you need to do."

grug once again catch grug slowly reaching for club, but grug stay calm

grug instead prefer write most tests after prototype phase, when code has begun firm up

but, note well: grug must here be very disciplined!

easy grug to move on and not write tests because "work on grugs machine"!

this very, very bad: no guarantee work on other machine and no guarantee work on grug machine in
future, many times

test shaman have good point on importance of test, even if test shaman often sometimes not complete
useful feature in life and talk only about test all time, deserve of club but heart in right place

also, test shaman often talk unit test very much, but grug not find so useful. grug experience that
ideal tests are not unit test or either end-to-end test, but in-between test

unit tests fine, ok, but break as implementation change (much compared api!) and make refactor hard
and, frankly, many bugs anyway often due interactions other code. often throw away when code change.

grug write unit test mostly at start of project, help get things going but not get too attached or
expect value long time

end to end tests good, show whole system work, but! hard to understand when break and drive grug
crazy very often, sometimes grugs just end up ignoring because "oh, that break all time" very bad!

in-between tests, grug hear shaman call "integration tests" sometime often with sour look on face.
but grug say integration test sweet spot according to grug: high level enough test correctness of
system, low level enough, with good debugger, easy to see what break

grug prefer some unit tests especially at start but not 100% all code test and definitely not "first
test". "test along the way" work pretty well for grug, especially as grug figure things out

grug focus much ferocious integration test effort as cut point emerge and system stabilize! cut
point api hopefully stable compared implementation and integration test remain valuable many long
time, and easy debug

also small, well curated end-to-end test suite is created to be kept working religiously on pain of
clubbing. focus of important end-to-end test on most common UI features and few most important edge
cases, but not too many or become impossible maintain and then ignored

this ideal set of test to grug

you may not like, but this peak grug testing

also, grug dislike mocking in test, prefer only when absolute necessary to (rare/never) and coarse
grain mocking (cut points/systems) only at that

one exception "first test" dislike by grug: when bug found. grug always try first reproduce bug with
regression test then fix bug, this case only for some reason work better
