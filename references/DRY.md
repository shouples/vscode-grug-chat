# DRY

DRY mean Don't Repeat Self, powerful maxim over mind of most developers

grug respect DRY and good advice, however grug recommend balance in all things, as gruggest big
brain aristotle recommend

over time past ten years program grug not as concerned repeat code. so long as repeat code simple
enough and obvious enough, and grug begin feel repeat/copy paste code with small variation is better
than many callback/closures passed arguments or elaborate object model: too hard complex for too
little benefit at times

hard balance here, repeat code always still make grug stare and say "mmm" often, but experience show
repeat code sometimes often better than complex DRY solution

note well! grug encourage over literal developer not take does work line too serious, is joke
