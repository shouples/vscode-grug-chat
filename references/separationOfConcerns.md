# Separation of Concerns (SoC)

Separation of Concern (SoC) another powerful idea over many developer mind, idea to separate
different aspects of system into distinct sections code

canonical example from web development: separation of style (css file), markup (html file) and logic
(javascript file)

here grug much more sour faced than DRY and in fact write big brained essay on alternative design
principle locality of behavior (LoB) against SoC

grug much prefer put code on the thing that do the thing. now when grug look at the thing grug know
the thing what the thing do, alwasy good relief!

when separate of concern grug must often all over tarnation many file look understand what how
button do, much confuse and time waste: bad!
